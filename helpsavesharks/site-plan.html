      <h3>Sharks & Shark Finning (Home) Page</h3>
      <p>
        Through the ages sharks have been looked at quite differently from what they actually are, thanks to mythology and popular culture.  
        The book, and then film “Jaws”, played a large role, and is often cited as the reason why people are so afraid of sharks, and why they are so misunderstood.  
        When you first hear the word “shark”, what first pops into your head?  Do you immediately think of some kind of sea monster, or killer?  Does the film Jaws come to mind?  
        When I was very young, I vividly remember seeing the movie Jaws, before that I did not really think much about sharks, I just thought of them as big fish, which they are, but the concept of being attacked, or eaten alive by a shark did not really come to mind, until I saw movies about it.  
        I then became very afraid of them, to the point that even swimming in a lake was a scary thought.  That fear led me to being very curious, and wanting to learn more about them.
        What are Sharks?
        Sharks are apex predators, the top of the food chain, the rulers of the ocean.  
        But they also have some nick names that you may have never heard of, and probably never would have associated them with.  
        Sharks are also the cleaners of the sea, many sharks do hunt, yes, but sharks are also scavengers, sharks are curious and cautious, they eat up all the dead creatures they find, like whales, or other sea creatures.

      <h3>Why are Sharks Important?</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to sharks contributing to keeping our oceans clean, they also take on the important role of keeping the ecosystem in check.  
        Without sharks keeping the population of their prey in check, it would cause a large imbalance of the ecosystem, and throw everything out of place, you might think that we would be better off without sharks because they are predators, but predators are very important to having a healthy ecosystem.
        If we suddenly took sharks completely out of the equation, certain species, namely the ones they hunt and eat, would grow out of control, this would also cause those creatures to eat up all of their prey, and now the entire oceans ecosystem would be ruined.  
        You might be asking yourself right now “well, how does that affect me?”  Or, “why should I care?”.  
        It has a greater effect on us then you might think.  
        Many people all over the world rely on food that comes from the ocean, a lot of these things are strongly regulated so that things like overfishing does not happen, if the oceans ecosystems were to get all messed up, so would our own food supplies.  
        You might not eat sea food, and might not think this would directly affect you, but you would probably be surprised just how many things we eat and use come from the ocean, not to mention there are lots of places in the world that do heavily rely on the food they get from the ocean.

      <h3>What is Shark Finning?</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have hopefully learned a bit more about what sharks are and why they are so important, I would like to get to the big issue.  
        You may or may not be surprised to find out that many shark species are either endangered, or at risk of becoming endangered.  
        Sharks themselves are used for food all over the world, though the practice of which has become more discouraged in recent times due to their endangerment.  
        In many cultures, especially in parts of Asia, sharks are specifically hunted for their fins, shark and even whale fins are quite coveted all over Asia, this has led to a practice commonly referred to as “shark finning”.  
        There are lots of fishermen that specifically fish for shark fins, not even the sharks themselves.  
        Shark finning is the act of catching sharks, cutting off all of their fins, and throwing the live shark back into the ocean, where it will sink to the ocean floor and drown.  
        These types of fishermen do this all day, day after day, killing countless sharks just for their fins.

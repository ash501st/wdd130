  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <h2>[Ashton Canepari]</h2>
  <p>I'm a CS major, 28 years old. And I love to play the piano, video games, and watch movies!</p>
  <p>I served my mission in Tohoku, Japan (formally known as the Japan, Sendai Mission), from 2013-2015.</p>
  <p>In 2021 I decided I wanted to make some changes in my life, so I enlisted into the United States Marine Corps.</p>
  <p>This required a 1 year break from school as I went through the USMC basic training, AKA "bootcamp".</p>  
  <p>13 weeks of brutal training at MCRD San Diego. After graduating I went to the School of Infantry for my 9 week</p>
  <p>infantry training course which consisted of the 0300 basic infantry course, and the 0311 rifleman course.</p>
  <p>I now serve with the 4th Marines in an infantry reserve company.</p>
